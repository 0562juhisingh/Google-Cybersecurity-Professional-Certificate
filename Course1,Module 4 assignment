Professional Statement

I am a PhD researcher with a developing professional focus on cybersecurity, built through extensive self-directed learning and continued engagement with cybersecurity professionals and industry discussions. This exposure has strengthened my understanding of real-world security challenges and reinforced my interest in applying analytical and research-driven thinking to practical security problems.
My key areas of interest include Software Development Security, Security Operations, Asset Security, Network Management, and effective technical communication. I bring strong problem-solving and analytical skills, a structured approach to identifying and mitigating risks, and a commitment to maintaining regulatory compliance and secure system practices across networked environments.
Alongside my doctoral research, I actively invest time in developing relevant cybersecurity skills by learning secure development methodologies, understanding network monitoring and security operations workflows, and improving my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I stay current with evolving threat landscapes, attack techniques, and defensive strategies, and I am motivated to contribute effectively within an industry cybersecurity team while continuing to grow my hands-on expertise.
